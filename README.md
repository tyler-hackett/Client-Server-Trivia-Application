# Client-Server-Trivia-Application

C, Sockets, POSIX Threads

Developed a multithreaded client-server trivia system in C using TCP/IP socket programming and POSIX threads. 
The server handles concurrent client connections, sends randomized trivia questions from a structured dataset, and verifies responses with score tracking. 
Implemented file I/O for question loading, custom protocol design for message exchange, and synchronized client handling using pthreads. Utilized a Makefile for build automation and modular compilation.
